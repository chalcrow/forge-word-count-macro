# Forge Word Count Macro (Typescript)

This project contains a Forge app written in Typescript that provides a word frequency counter as a Confluence macro. 

See [developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge) for documentation and tutorials explaining Forge.

## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## Quick start

- Build and deploy your app by running:
```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:
```
forge install
```

- Develop your app by running `forge tunnel` to proxy invocations locally:
```
forge tunnel
```

## Tests

Jest tests are included and can be invoked with `npm jest`
Configuration is present for debugging unit tests in Visual Studio Code.
To debug, add breakpoints and select the `Jest:current file` profile under Visual Studio Code 'Run and debug' (CRTL + Shift + D).   

### Notes
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
